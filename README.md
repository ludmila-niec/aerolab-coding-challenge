## Goals
The challenge is to build a catalog view for a loyalty program app.
The product‚Äôs main goal is to help users redeem items through a points-based system.
Users have an undetermined amount of points accumulated, and each product is worth a set amount of points.
- Each product should have a visible price in points.
- The user should be able to sort products by price, from highest to lowest, and vice-versa.
- The user should be able to see how many points they have in their account.
- There should be a clear way for the user to distinguish those products that they can redeem from those they cannot.
- A ‚ÄúRedeem‚Äù button should be available for those products that the user has enough points to claim.
- A ‚ÄúRedeem now‚Äù option should appear when the user interacts with a product that they have enough points to claim.
- When the user doesn‚Äôt have enough points for a product, they should be able to see how many more points they need to claim it.
- The user should not be able to redeem a product for which they don‚Äôt have enough points.
- When the user clicks on the Redeem now button, the system should automatically deduct the item‚Äôs price from the users‚Äô points.
